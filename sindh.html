                            Sindh is the second largest province of pakistan with its capital in Karachi, which is not
                            only the most populous metropolis of the country, but also, a commercial hub.

                            The province of Sindh has two gigantic seaports and both are located in Karachi. The biggest
                            international airport of Pakistan is also situated in Karachi and is widely known as
                            Qaid-e-Azam International airport.

                            The Province of Sindh forms the lower Indus basin and lies between 23 to 35 Degree and
                            28-30, north latitude and 66-42 and 71-1-degree east longitude. It is about 579 kms in
                            length from north to south and nearly 442 kms in its extreme breadth (281 kms average). It
                            covers 1,40,915 square kms and is about as large as England.

                            Sindh is also proud of having acquired fame as Bab-ul-Islam (Gateway to Islam in the
                            Indo-Pakistan subcontinent). At the time of the independence from the British occupation in
                            August 1947, the population of Sindh was estimated at 5.5 million. Today, after the passage
                            of fifty years the population of the province stands around 40 million souls, a half of whom
                            now live in the urban centres like Hyderabad, Sukkur, Mirpurkhas, Tando Adam, Nawabshah,
                            Larkana, Shikarpur, Khairpur, Badin and other smaller towns. It is basically an agrarian
                            province. The Indus is by far the most important river of the province. The classical name
                            of the river was Sindhu (Sanskrit for an ocean) and Sindh province was created and sustained
                            by the river, without which it would have been a desert. Its length is about 2,880
                            kilometers and nearly a third of that (about 944 Kms) traverses the province. The striking
                            resemblance of Sindh to Egypt was noticed long before the existence in it of a comparable
                            great prehistoric civilization was even suspected; the idiosyncrasy of its people when
                            compared with Indians, is very marked. There is an ancient saying "Just as Egypt is the gift
                            of Nile, Sindh is the gift of the Indus".

                            Owing to its prevalent aridity and the absence of the monsoons, the climate of Sindh ranks
                            among the hottest and is most variable. The average temperature of the summer months is 35
                            degrees centigrade and those of inter months 16. But the thermometer frequently rises in
                            summer to 45 and occasionally to 50.In the northern part of Sindh the extremes of
                            temperature are strongly marked. Jacobabad boasts of the highest temperature yet recorded at
                            a Pakistani meteorological station i.e.52 degrees centigrade in June 1919. Sehwan is another
                            hot place while Hyderabad is on the average pleasant due to cool breeze.

                            Cotton, rice, wheat and sugarcane are the main crops produced in Sindh. Rice is by far the
                            most important crop cultivated here. It is the only crop that can be grown in the annually
                            inundated lands within the delta of the Indus and a larger quantity and much finer quality
                            is produced in the Larkana district. In Jacobabad, Sukkur, Badin, Thatta and Dadu, also, a
                            great quantity of rice is cultivated. Cotton is produced mainly in Sanghar, Nawabshah, and
                            Hyderabad, Sugarcane is another important crop which is chiefly grown in the Ghulam Mohammad
                            Barrage zone in South. Sindh is proud of its bananas and mangoes also.

                            The waters around Karachi are rich with seafood and are considered to be some of the best
                            fishing spots in the world. Surmai, pomphret, lobsters, shrimps, sharks, dolphins,
                            crocodiles and other aquatic life especially Pallas exists in plenty in the sea as well as
                            in the sweet waters of the Indus, Manchar, Keenjhar, Haleji and other lakes.

                            Within the last 45 years, three irrigation barrages have been constructed across the Indus
                            in the province. The command areas of the three barrages are: Sukkur barrage 3.12 million
                            hectares, Kotri barrage 1.12 million hectares, and Guddu barrage 1.172 million hectares.

                            The province of Sindh had traditionally been rich in wildlife heritage. Its Kirthar National
                            Park, about 70 k.m. of North West of Karachi, is enlisted on World Heritage. Other side at
                            Haleji Lake and Thar area are also of paramount importance.

                            Though chiefly an agricultural and pastoral province, Sindh has a reputation for textiles,
                            pottery, leatherwork, carpets etc. The craftsmanship of the people of Sindh began during the
                            period of Moenjodaro civilization. Their polished ornaments and articles of apparel made out
                            of muslin and wooden lacquer work have won the praise in and outside the country.

                        provide more than a cursory overview of this important site.
                        There are several different spellings of the site name and in this article we have chosen to use
                        the most common form, Mohenjo-daro (the Mound of Mohen or Mohan), though other spellings are
                        equally valid: Mohanjo-daro (Mound of Mohan =Krishna), Moenjo-daro (Mound of the Dead),
                        Mohenjo-daro, Mohenjodaro or even Mohen-jo-daro. Many publications still state that Mohenjo-daro
                        is located in India (presumably referring to ancient India), but since the creation of Pakistan
                        in 1947, the site has been under the protection of the Department of Archaeology and Museums,
                        Government of Pakistan.

                        <h3 class="card-title pt-2"><strong>Khairpur (Mirs)</strong></h3>
                        <p class="text-justify px-5">Faiz Mahal in Khairpur (Mirs), down to the dishevelled array of
                            security personnel, is
                            nondescript. In all its renovated glory, Faiz Mahal comes into view only after you turn a
                            sharp bend on the gravel-shorn road that must have once been adorned by regal vehicles
                            ferrying even more regal human freight.

                            Today, it stands in forlorn splendour, its current owners probably hard put in reviving the
                            original glory that was lost to years of state apathy, a shortage of funds and the sheer
                            helplessness of the Talpur executives of the estate when it came to tackling such a huge
                            renovation project. It is only in very recent times that the historic, architectural and
                            heritage values of the building were taken into consideration. As a result, a painstaking
                            renovation process has given Faiz Mahal a second lease of life. The once withering
                            structure, where for a time (to quote Keats from La Belle Dame Sans Merci) ‘no birds sang’
                            and where the ‘sedge has withered from the lake’, now sings a different tune: majestic
                            grace, albeit with shades of nostalgia.

                            Standing proud over acres of prime real estate in Khairpur (Mirs), the mighty pink palace
                            with its white trimmings, delicately-shaped balconies resting on cupolas of lily leaves, the
                            sunbeams filtering florescent through the windows and tiers of countless rooms, bring back
                            memories of the early days of the Talpur dynasty. Having wrested the fiefdom from the
                            Kalhoras for whose defence they had been commissioned, the Talpur foot soldiers had set up
                            their own dynasty in 1783. Thereafter, had begun a reign of peace and prosperity riddled
                            only by occasional familial disputes that resolved in due time. Faiz Mahal was built by Mir
                            Sohrab Khan in 1798 and presently it serves as the home of H.H. Mir Murad Ali Khan Talpur ll
                            and his sons Prince Abbas Raza Talpur and Prince Prince Mehdi Raza Talpur.</p>
