                            Punjab, province of eastern Pakistan. It is bordered by the Indian state of Jammu and
                            Kashmir to the northeast, the Indian states of Punjab and Rajasthan to the east, Sindh
                            province to the south, Balochistān and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces to the west, and
                            Islamabad federal capital area and Azad Kashmir to the north. The provincial capital,
                            Lahore, is located in the east-central region, near the border with India. The name Punjab
                            means “five waters,” or “five rivers,” and signifies the land drained by the Jhelum, Chenab,
                            Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, which are tributaries of the Indus River. Punjab is
                            Pakistan’s second largest province, after Balochistān, and the most densely populated. Area
                            79,284 square miles (205,345 square km). Pop. (2011 est.) 91,379,615.
                            Punjab’s area mostly consists of an alluvial plain formed by the southward-flowing Indus
                            River and its four major tributaries in Pakistan, the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej
                            rivers. The general slope of the land is from northeast to southwest, but it rises in the
                            areas between rivers. The alluvial plain has a diversity of landforms: its active
                            floodplains are flooded every rainy season and contain changing river channels, while
                            meander floodplains lying adjacent to the active floodplain are marked by relict and
                            abandoned channels. In the northern parts of the province are the Murree and Rawalpindi and
                            the Pabbi hills, part of the Sub-Himalayas, and in the far north is the Potwar Plateau.
                            Although the region is a traditional floodplain, the extraordinary flooding of the Indus
                            River in the summer of 2010 was especially disastrous in Punjab, where millions of people
                            were affected (by some estimates, one-half of all Pakistanis affected were in Punjab). The
                            government’s failure to alert the public of the impending disaster elicited much criticism;
                            some felt that officials, having had previous experience handling flooding there, should
                            have been able to provide Punjabis with more forewarning.
                            Punjab is the most populous province of Pakistan, containing more than half the country’s
                            total population as well as several of its major cities: Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi,
                            Multān, and Gujranwala. There is considerable rural-to-urban migration in the province,
                            especially to the larger cities. In religion, the province is almost entirely Muslim, with a
                            small Christian minority. Punjabi is the mother tongue of the great majority of the
                            population. The main written language is Urdu, followed by English. The major ethnic groups
                            are the Jat, Rajput, Arain, Gujar, and Awan. The caste system is gradually becoming blurred
                            as a result of increasing social mobility, intercaste marriages, and changing public
                            opinion.

                        <p class="text-justify px-5"> Punjab’s state of Bahawalpur is famous for its majestically
                            well-preserved palace – the Noor Mahal, People can now visit and be enchanted by the
                            architectural magnificence of the palace that is remembered as a symbol of love.
                            Built in 1872 by Nawab Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abbasi IV for his wife Noor, the palace cost Rs
                            1.2 million rupees at the time.
                            The palace, which faces the beautiful gardens, has large corridors, and windowpanes, which
                            reflects sunlight inside the building. This building is a reflection of marvelous intricate
                            details. More than two centuries old, this palace has been preserved to its original form
                            with all its details, from furniture to wall paintings and even a piano, which has been
                            preserved. The ceilings and floor tiles have been designed in complex geometrical shapes
                            with many attractive colours. Once a week, a light and sound show is held at the palace
                            displaying the splendour of the palace in all its glory.
                            Unfortunately, the royal family only lived in the palace for one day. The reason for their
                            short stay is said to be due to the locality, close to which was a graveyard.
                            ] The administration responsible for the preservation of the palace has now opened it for
                            public viewing. Besides the beautiful sights of the palace there is a hotel and children’s
                            park to attract more visitors.
