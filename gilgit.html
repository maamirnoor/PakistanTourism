                            regions that have an autonomous status in Pakistan. Nowadays this region is known as
                            Gilgit-Baltistan, the capital of this region is Gilgit. India does not recognize this region
                            as part of Pakistan and classifies it as being part of the Indian province of Kashmir. This
                            has given rise to one of the largest conflicts between these two countries. Gilgit is an old
                            city which has been an important trading post for centuries because of its situation on the
                            silk route.
                            The Climate of Gilgit varies from region to region; surrounding mountain ranges creates
                            sharp variations in weather. The eastern part has the moist zone of the western Himalayas,
                            but going towards Karakoram and Hindu Kush the climate dries considerably. Gilgit is hot
                            during the day in summer yet cold at night and valleys like Astore, Khalpu, Yasin, Hunza and
                            Nagar where the temperature is cold even during the summer.
                            Gilgit is home to a number of diversified cultures, ethnic groups, languages and various
                            backgrounds. It is home to people belonging to all regions of Gilgit as well as from other
                            cities of Pakistan and aboard. This multitude of cultures is because of the strategic
                            location of Gilgit. Being the headquarters of the Gilgit-Baltistan almost of the key offices
                            are located in Gilgit.

                        the Aga Khan Development Network and is now managed by Serena Hotels. The fort was constructed
                        by Raja Hassan Khan, the 20th Raja of the Amacha dynasty, in early 17th century.

                        The Amachas arrived in Shigar around 11th century after fleeing persecution from the Ganesh in
                        Hunza. The elders travelled for days through foot-deep snow over the Hispar glacier and braved
                        storms and finally landed into the Shigar Valley, where they built fort Khar-i-Dong.

                        The original fort was on top of a cliff, but after a few peaceful centuries, the Mughals arrived
                        and in a battle that lasted many days, the Amachas were uprooted and the fort destroyed.

                        However, once the Amachas submitted, the Mughals left them in peace. The 20th ruler of the
                        dynasty then built the current fort on top of a huge boulder and named it Fong Khar — Palace on
                        the Rock.

                        <p class="text-justify px-5">Baltit Fort is situated in Karimabad, once was capital of the state
                            of Hunza, now Tehsil Headquarter of District Gilgit. It is approached by Karakuram Highway
                            from Gilgit, the capital of Northern Areas, Pakistan. The Baltit Fort stands on a
                            artificially flattened spur below the Ulter Glacier. Strategically located with a commanding
                            view of the Hunza Valley and its Tributaries, its inhabitants controlled the seasonal
                            trans-Karakuram trade between south and Central Asia. The Baltit Fort is rectangular in plan
                            with three floors and stands on a high stone plinth Fig-I. Whilts the ground floor consist
                            mainly of storage chambers, the first floor is oriented around as open hall. A staircase
                            leads to the second floor which was mainly used during the winter months and contains an
                            audience hall, guest room, dining hall, kitchen and servants quarters. A further staircases
                            leads up to the third floor which is partly open to the elements and contains the summer
                            dining room, audience chamber, bedroom and reception hall. Inhabited by the Mir, or ruler of
                            Hunza until 1945. The conservation work carried out in the 1990 indicated that the core of
                            the structures, a single defensive timber and stone tower, had been built in the eight
                            century A.D. This tower was augmented by additional towers and linked by a single story
                            construction consisting of small rooms and sub-surface storage chambers. The complex was
                            then later expanded by the addition of a second, and then a third floor. The structure’s
                            stone walls, built in an area of frequent seismic movements, were provided with a
                            traditional internal framework of timber for greater stabilisation.</p>
